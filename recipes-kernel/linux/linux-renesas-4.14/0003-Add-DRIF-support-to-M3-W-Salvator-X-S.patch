Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Add DRIF support to M3-W Salvator-X[S]

It is possible to add SDR support to M3-W Salvator-X and M3-W
Salvator-XS boards by means of Maxim's J5 board (and some HW
modifications).

This patch adds four new device trees:
* r8a7796-salvator-xs-drif01.dts, to add DRIF0 and DRIF1 support
  to a modified M3-W Salvator-XS board with a Maxim J5 add-on
  board plugged in connector EXIO_B CN27
* r8a7796-salvator-xs-drif23.dts, to similarly add DRIF2 and DRIF3
  support to a modified M3-W Salvator-XS board with a Maxim J5
  add-on board plugged in connector EXIO_B CN27
* r8a7796-salvator-x-drif01.dts, same as
  r8a7796-salvator-xs-drif01.dts, only for M3-W Salvator-X board
* r8a7796-salvator-x-drif23.dts, same as
  r8a7796-salvator-xs-drif23.dts, only for M3-W Salvator-X board
