Subject: [PATCH] Add DRIF support to H3 Salvator-X[S]

It is possible to add SDR support to H3 Salvator-X and H3
Salvator-XS boards by means of Maxim's J5 board (and some HW
modifications).

This patch adds four new device trees:
* r8a7795-salvator-xs-drif01.dts, to add DRIF0 and DRIF1 support
to a modified H3 Salvator-XS board with a Maxim J5 add-on
board plugged in connector EXIO_B CN27
* r8a7795-salvator-xs-drif23.dts, to similarly add DRIF2 and DRIF3
support to a modified H3 Salvator-XS board with a Maxim J5
add-on board plugged in connector EXIO_B CN27
* r8a7795-salvator-x-drif01.dts, same as
r8a7795-salvator-xs-drif01.dts, only for H3 Salvator-X board
* r8a7795-salvator-x-drif23.dts, same as
r8a7795-salvator-xs-drif23.dts, only for H3 Salvator-X board
